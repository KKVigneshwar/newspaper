                    <p class="parag">
                        David Billa, a Sri Lankan refugee, along with several others, arrives at a camp in Rameswaram, where he befriends Ranjith. The refugee camp is constantly terrorised by corrupt police Inspector Raghubir Sinha. Billa attacks Raghubir when he tries to forcefully detain one of his friends and, in return, gets tortured in a police cell. Billa vows to make him suffer.

                    He goes to meet his widowed sister in Chennai as she is his sole living relative, but is shunned by her due to his criminal past in Lanka. A few days later, Billa and Ranjith are hired to transport fish from Rameswaram to Chennai, which is a plot by Raghubir to trap them as the truck they are driving has diamonds inside. Police intercept them to arrest them, but Billa realises the play and kills all the cops.

                <p class="amet">When Billa and Ranjith retrieve Dmitri's arms consignment held by the Indian coastal guard, they enter his good books. Billa climbs the ladder of Abbasi's gang quickly. He learns of his elder sister's death and brings his only niece Jasmine with him. He provides her with a big house and servants, and enrolls her in a medical college. Billa and Koti travel to Russia to meet Dimitri, who happens to own a large arms and ammunition manufacturing unit. Billa meets international Don Jagdeesh in Dimitri's mansion, and is astonished by the functioning of an international mafia. Billa signs a larger annual deal with Dimitri without Abbasi's knowledge, who learns this from Koti and is furious at Billa. Tensions further increase when Billa beats up Satish Kumar, the son of an influential minister Praveen Kumar, when he tries to misbehave with Jasmine in a party.</p>
